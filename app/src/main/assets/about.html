    <h2>About KidsTv</h2>

    <p class="attention-grabber">
        This app is a safe video player/ android launcher with parental control, so you can chose what your kids are
        watching, what apps and games they can use, and how long they can use the device.<br/>
        What makes this app unique, is the fact that it is 100% free and opensource, zero analytics or tracking, zero
        data going to anyone server, cause the only person checking in your kids, should be you.
