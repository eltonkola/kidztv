This app is a safe video player/ android launcher with parental control, so you can chose what your kids are
watching, what apps and games they can use, and how long they can use the device.<br/>
What makes this app unique, is the fact that it is 100% free and opensource, zero analytics or tracking, zero
data going to anyone server, cause the only person checking in your kids, should be you.
